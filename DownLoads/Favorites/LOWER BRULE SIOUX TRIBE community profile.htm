<P><B>LOWER BRULE SIOUX TRIBAL GOVERNMENT:</B></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The United States Government as defined by the United States 
Constitution has governmental relationships with International, Tribal, and 
State entities. The Tribal nations have a government-to-government relationship 
with the United States. The Tribes of the Great Sioux Nation signed treaties in 
1824, 1851, 1865 and 1868 with the United States which are the legal documents 
that established our boundaries and recognized our rights as sovereign 
governments.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The Kul Wicasa Oyate or Lower Brule Sioux Tribe are a Tribe of 
the Sicangu, or Burned Thighs, named the Brule’ by the French traders in the 
days prior to diplomatic relations with the United States government. The Kul 
Wicasa Oyate was originally designated reservation lands along the Missouri 
River recognized in a treaty with the United States signed on October 14, 1865. 
The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe was further defined and the boundaries expanded by 
the Act of March 2, 1889 which identified all the reservations in present day 
North and South Dakota. This includes all right-of-way, waterways, watercourses 
and streams running through any part of the reservation and to such others lands 
as may hereafter be added to the reservation under the law of the United States. 
The original reservation was reduced to its present size by approximately 50 
percent through subsequent Homestead Acts to provide land for non-Indian 
settlers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe operates under a constitution and a 
federal corporate charter consistent with the Indian Reorganization Act of June 
18, 1934. The Tribal Council governs the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe. The Tribal 
Council consists of a Chairman, Vice-Chairman, a Secretary/Treasurer and three 
additional Council people all of whom are elected by the tribal 
membership.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The Tribal Council Chairman serves as the administrative head of 
the Tribe. The Tribal Chairman, Officers and Council serve a term of two years 
at-large without regard to residence in any district. Over 90 percent of the 
population now live in the community and district known as Lower Brule. The 
construction of the Big Bend and Fort Randall dams on the Missouri River forced 
many families and the entire community of Lower Brule to completely relocate to 
higher ground. Prior to the inundation of lands along the Missouri River, the 
population was divided into four districts and represented as such on the Tribal 
Council. The districts are still referenced as geographic areas on the 
reservations, including Fort George, Iron Nation, Lower Brule, and Fort 
Hale.</FONT></P>

<P><B>LAND:</B></P>
<P>The Lower Brule Sioux Reservation is located in the central portion of South 
Dakota, 15 miles southeast of Pierre, SD and 16 miles north of Reliance, SD on 
Interstate 90. The reservation boundaries on the east and north include lakes 
Sharpe and Francis Case, the large reservoirs formed by mainstem dams on the 
Missouri River. The reservation covers an area of about 404 square miles within 
Lyman and Stanley counties. Of this area about 35 square miles are covered by 
major reservoirs and about 201 square miles are owned by the Tribe and Tribal 
members. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe maintains the right and responsibility to 
provide environmental authority in compliance with Tribal and Federal law for 
protection of the land and resources within the exterior boundaries of the 
reservation through code development and regulatory procedures. The maintenance 
and protection of the land is very important to the Kul Wicasa people and our 
future generations.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>CULTURE:</B></P>
<P>The Great Sioux Nation is also called The Lakota Nation, Tetons and the 
Western Sioux. The people of the Sioux Nation refer to themselves as 
Lakota/Dakota which means friend or ally. The United States government took the 
word Sioux from (Nadowesioux), which comes from a Chippewa (Ojibway) word which 
means little snake or enemy. The French traders and trappers who worked with the 
Chippewa( Ojibway) people shortened the word to Sioux.</P>
<P>The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe has always been known among the Lakota Nation as 
the Kul Wicasa Oyate and with the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, or Upper Brules composed 
the Sicangu Oyate, the Burned Thighs. The Lakota Nation or Great Sioux Nation 
includes the Oglala, Brule, Minnecoujou, Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, Without Bows and 
Two Kettle. The Lakotas speak an 'L' dialect of Siouan language and were expert 
horsemen and buffalo hunters on the plains. The Ihanktowan, or Yankton and 
Yanktonais are called the Wicayela or Middle Sioux. The Isanti people are 
comprised of four bands that lived on the eastern side of the Lakota/Dakota 
Nation. The Isanti and Ihanktowan speak the 'D' and ‘N’ dialect of Siouan 
language. Both were a river-plains people who did some farming as well as 
buffalo hunting.</P>
<P>The government identified all the Tribes with similar languages as the Sioux 
people. The oral tradition of our people state that the Lakota and Dakota people 
were one nation. The Lakota people moved away and formed their own nation. The 
Lakota/Dakota people still practice their sacred and traditional ceremonies 
which encompass the seven rites of Lakota Nation brought by the White Buffalo 
Calf Woman.</P>
<P>Social activities such as powwow, rodeos, and races are celebrated in the 
summer months. Special powwows held for an individual accomplishment, reaching a 
certain stage in their lives such as graduation or acceptance into the armed 
forces with traditional honoring ceremonies, give-aways, and feasts to celebrate 
their accomplishments. The oral tradition is still passed down from the elders 
to the youth.</P>
<P>The future of the Kul Wicasa Oyate is directly related to the protection of 
our homelands and how well we enable our children to continue our cultural 
traditions and manage our resources in rebuilding our economy. We believe the 
children of the Kul Wicasa Oyate and the Lakota/Dakota Nation have the desire 
and the ability to survive, grow, and rebuild our Nation in the 21st 
century.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>HISTORY:</B></P>
<P>The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe is part of the Great Sioux Nation as the Kul 
Wicasa of the Sicangu Oyate. The Great Sioux Nation retains our land base in 
accordance with the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. At one time, The Great Sioux 
Nation extended from the Big Horn Mountains in the west to the west side of 
Wisconsin and from Canada in the North to the Republican River in the south. The 
Great Sioux Nation was reduced in the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty from the Big Horn 
mountains in the west to the east bank of the Missouri River, including parts of 
North Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana. This includes all of western South 
Dakota in the middle of the treaty lands.</P>
<P>The Black Hills are located in the center the Great Sioux Nation. The Black 
Hills are sacred to the Lakota/ Dakota people and today considered an important 
part of our spiritual lives. A direct violation of the 1868 Treaty was committed 
in 1874 by General George A. Custer and his 7th Cavalry. The 7th Cavalry entered 
the Black Hills, the center of the Great Sioux Nation and found gold in the 
Black Hills. The Gold Rush started the conflict between the United States and 
Great Sioux Nation. The Great Sioux Nation opposed this violation of the treaty. 
The United States Government wanted to buy or rent the Black Hills from the 
Lakota people. The Great Sioux Nation refused to sell or rent their sacred 
lands.</P>
<P>The 7th Cavalry under General George A. Custer was requested to bring the 
Sioux bands in and place them on the reservation lands. On June 25, 1876, the 
Battle of the Little Big Horn between the 7th Cavalry and Lakota Nation with 
their allies Cheyenne and Araphoes at Greasy Grass, Montana took place. The 
Sioux Nation won a victory over General George A. Custer and his 7th 
Cavalry.</P>
<P>The Great Sioux Nation scattered, some to Canada and others surrendered to 
the reservations. The United States Government demanded that the Lakota nation 
move to the reservations. The people finally surrendered after being cold and 
hungry and moved on the reservations. The government still insisted buying the 
Black Hills from the Lakota people. The Sioux (Lakota) Nation refused to sell 
their sacred lands. The United States Government introduced the Sell or Starve 
Bill or the Agreement of 1877, which illegally took the Black Hills from the 
Great Sioux Nation. The Lakota people starved but refused to sell their sacred 
land. The Allotment Act of 1887 allotted Indian lands into 160 acre tracts to 
individual heads of households and 80 acres to adult males which further divided 
the nation. The Act of 1889 broke up the Great Sioux Nation into smaller 
reservations, the remainder of which exist today at about one half their 
original size in 1889.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>CLIMATE:</B></P>
<P>The average rainfall is 16-17 inches during the summer season. The growing 
season lasts three months, June through August. The snow fall averages from 
moderate to heavy for winter weather. The temperature in the winter is from 30 
degrees below zero with an average of 20 degrees above zero. The average 
temperature in the summer is 80 degrees but will range from 69 degrees to 110 
degrees from June to August. The wind averages 14 mph per day annually. The area 
suffers from occasional droughts in the summer and severe blizzards in the 
winter. The spring and fall seasons are very pleasant.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>TRANSPORTATION:</B></P>
<P>The Lower Brule Sioux Reservation is served by Highway 47 to the Big Bend 
Dam, BIA 10, a connecting road from Lower Brule, South Dakota south 16 miles to 
Interstate 90, and a county road through Kennebec, South Dakota to I-90. The 
Lewis and Clark Trail or historical highway 1806 runs along the Missouri River 
from Lower Brule to Fort Pierre, South Dakota. There is no public nor major 
transportation facilities existing on the reservation. There are some charter 
buses and limousine services for patrons of the Golden Buffalo Casino in Lower 
Brule. The Greyhound Bus services are located in Chamberlain and Pierre, South 
Dakota. The nearest commercial airline is in Pierre, South Dakota, 65 miles 
northwest of the community of Lower Brule.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B>TRIBAL ECONOMY:</B></P>
<P>The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe’s major economic occupation is cattle ranching 
and farming for 26 tribal operators. The Tribe operates two large irrigated 
farms, 5,900 acres under the Lower Brule Farm Corporation, a tribal construction 
enterprise, and guided hunting for small game, big game, and a goose camp 
operation. The Tribe also operates the Golden Buffalo Casino and Motel with a 
convention center, an RV Park, and a gas station. A recent tribal venture is the 
offering of tour packages on a daily and weekly basis including historical and 
cultural attractions for both national and global tourists from several 
countries.</P>
<P>Commercial business by private operators include a convenience store, 
laundromat, and a video arcade/fast food shop, hunting/fishing guide service, 
arts and handcrafts, a small motel, and a branch of Norwest Bank.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><I>Reservation Water System</I>: Water is the key to increasing the quality 
of life and promoting full economic development on the Lower Brule Reservation. 
An adequate supply of good quality water is needed by the (1,178) Indians and 
(184) non-Indians living on the reservation.</P>
<P>Problems with water quality and inadequate supply are common throughout the 
reservation. This condition has a detrimental effect on health and quality of 
life as well as deterring economic growth. The availability of a plentiful and 
high quality water supply is vital to the health and well being of the people 
living on the Lower Brule Reservation. The level health and quality of life of 
the general population is directly related to the quality of their domestic 
water supply. Many residents currently depend on poorly constructed or low 
capacity individual wells. These sources are often contaminated with bacteria or 
undesirable minerals, provide an inadequate quantity of water, and are costly to 
maintain and operate. Many people wish to return to their family lands or 
relocate to rural areas to raise their families but are limited by the 
unavailability of water.</P>
<P>Agriculture is the primary industry on the Lower Brule Reservation and the 
key to the full development of this industry is water. Surface water in small 
streams, lakes, and dugouts is scattered throughout the area. Surface water, 
however, is a unreliable year-round supply and generally available only during 
the wet periods of spring and summer. During drought periods, these sources 
often dry up, and livestock must be sold or moved off the reservation. Shallow 
groundwater is scarce and unreliable and deep groundwater, while generally more 
plentiful, is highly mineralized and of poor quality. This lack of an adequate 
water supply has also reduced the livestock production on the reservation. The 
grazing lands cannot be fully utilized and valuable resource is wasted. The lack 
of stability in the production of feeder-cattle also discourages related 
industrial development such as cattle feeding, packing plants, and other value 
added industries.</P>
<P><I>Hydrologic Setting</I>: Shallow groundwater is not obtainable on most of 
the Lower Brule Indian Reservation, and where it is found, it is often of poor 
quality. Surface waters, with the exception of the Missouri River, though 
valuable and widely distributed resources, are undependable because of scanty 
and erratic precipitation. Artesian water from deeply buried bedrock aquifers 
underlies all of the reservation. These aquifers are not, and probably will not 
become highly developed sources of water because of the high-to-very-high 
salinity and other mineral content of artesian water in most of the area.</P>
<P><I>Water Availability and Use</I>: Surface water is the major water source 
for the reservation with the Missouri River providing by far the largest part of 
the surface water supply. Other reservation streams have extremely variable flow 
patterns and are not reliable enough for a year-round supply. Groundwater is not 
as abundant as surface water and where available it is usually adequate for only 
small scale use. For these reasons, the Missouri River is the obvious source for 
a reservation water supply system. The Lower Brule Sioux Tribe is a part of the 
Mni Wiconi Project for delivery of Missouri River water to the Pine Ridge, 
Rosebud and Lower Brule Reservations.</P>
<P>Lower Brule currently utilizes the Missouri River as the source for the 
community water system at a current level of 150,000 gallons per day. The water 
system serves the Lower Brule and the West Brule community located three miles 
west as well as a number of scattered sites in the area. Plans are under 
consideration to supply water from the existing intake for portions of the 
Lyman-Jones and the Lower Brule Rural Water Supply System under the Mni Wiconi 
Project.</P>
<P>The Bureau of Indian Affairs NRIS data identifies a total of 15,803 acres of 
farmland on the Lower Brule reservation, including 8,294 of irrigated acres. A 
recent study completed by the U.S. Geological Survey will be researched for 
information on quantity of use.</P>
<P><I>Terrain</I>: Rolling hills, river breaks, and stock dams dominate the 
reservation.</P>
